Hi! I am a ~~fourth~~ fifth-year PhD student in the [GLAMOR Lab](https://glamor-usc.github.io/) at the University of Southern California, where I am working with [Prof. Jesse Thomason](https://jessethomason.com/) on <b>user-centric approaches to building reliable LLM-based systems</b>. My research lies at the intersection of human-AI interaction, uncertainty quantification, and training human-centered LLM agents. I am currently also collaborating with the research team at [Contextual AI](https://contextual.ai/).

I have previously completed research internships at [AI2 Mosaic](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) and Microsoft Research, and before my PhD I briefly worked as an NLP Research Scientist at AI Foundation. I completed my Masters from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/), [Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) and [Prof. Florian Metze](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html). Prior to CMU, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, majoring in Mechanical Engineering, with a Minor degree in Computer Science.
